            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected devices that communicate and share data over the internet. These devices range from everyday objects like smart home appliances and wearables to complex industrial machinery. By embedding sensors and software, IoT enables real-time data collection and remote monitoring, making systems smarter and more efficient.</p>
            
            <p>In 2025, IoT is expected to revolutionize various industries. In healthcare, remote patient monitoring through IoT devices will enhance diagnostics and treatment efficiency. Smart cities will leverage IoT for better traffic management, energy conservation, and public safety. In agriculture, IoT-powered sensors will help monitor soil conditions, automate irrigation, and optimize crop yields.</p>
            
            <p>However, IoT also presents challenges, especially regarding security and privacy. As more devices become interconnected, the risk of cyberattacks increases. Ensuring robust data encryption and secure authentication protocols is essential. Despite the challenges, IoT continues to drive innovation, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with technology.</p>

            <p>As technology advances, cybersecurity threats are becoming more sophisticated. In 2025, companies will face challenges like ransomware attacks, data breaches, and AI-driven hacking attempts. To combat these threats, organizations are investing in multi-factor authentication (MFA), zero-trust architecture, and AI-powered threat detection. Individuals are also encouraged to adopt stronger password practices and use VPNs for safer browsing.</p>
            
            <p>Recent innovations in green computing include advanced power management systems, carbon-neutral cloud services, and biodegradable electronic components. These developments are not only reducing the environmental impact of technology but also leading to cost savings and improved performance.</p>
